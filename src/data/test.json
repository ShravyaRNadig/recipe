                " Some traditionalists soak the rice and dal seperately, grind them separately, and then mix them. ",
                "To me that just adds unnecessary steps and I prefer to just soak everything together and pay closer attention when I blend so I get the texture right.",
                " Rice takes just a little longer to blend than the dal, which is perfect because you want the dal to blend smoothly while the rice remains very slightly gritty.",
                " That helps the dosas turn out crispy. Always drain out the water you soaked the rice and dal in and add fresh, preferably filtered water when you blend the batter."
