            "waysToPrepare": "Allow the rice and dal and other ingredients to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. I usually soak them in the morning, blend up the dosa batter in the evening, and leave it to ferment overnight so I can make fresh dosas next morning. Some traditionalists soak the rice and dal seperately, grind them separately, and then mix them. To me that just adds unnecessary steps and I prefer to just soak everything together and pay closer attention when I blend so I get the texture right. Rice takes just a little longer to blend than the dal, which is perfect because you want the dal to blend smoothly while the rice remains very slightly gritty. That helps the dosas turn out crispy. Always drain out the water you soaked the rice and dal in and add fresh, preferably filtered water when you blend the batter."

(Dal’s size and volume would increase to almost double after soaking.)Rinse both parboiled and basmati rice together in water for 3-4 times. (Place both types of rice in a large bowl and fill it with water till ¾th height. Rub rice grains between your fingers; this will make water turn cloudy. Drain the water and repeat the process for 3-4 times to rinse them properly.) Soak them together in 2-cups of water for around 4-5 hours.Drain excess water from soaked urad dal and reserve it to use in grinding process in next step. Transfer drained dal and fenugreek seeds into large jar of mixer grinder or wet grinder."
